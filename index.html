                    <p>“Liz is an absolute blessing of a person to work with decorating your home, office or ANY creative/technical project. She has one of the most beautiful and authentic heart that I’ve ever seen. She is also exceptionally talented with high efficiency and effectiveness at managing tasks and negotiated vendor’s costs down.
                            She has a glowing grace about her in her conscious clarity of communication with all parties. I am so looking forward to the next time I can engage her because she is a joy to work with and a powerful force of nature.”</p>

                    <p>“What can I say, there is no one like Liz! You might think of us as ‘competitors’ in our industry, but one of the first times I was in a crisis, Liz came to the rescue!
                            She may have a long list of things to do, but is always wanting, with her whole heart, to help! A few years back, we figured out a way to work together and build a relationship and that was one the best things I did. Her care for her work is based on the details. She has a desire to do not just do a good job, but to go above and beyond!
                            People base their value on material things, but Liz really cares about the real stuff, she always has a smile on her face, asks how you are, has a snack or water if you need it. There are very few people like her in the world. Her work ethic, the care of the product she delivers to you and just her kind soul makes the world a better place.”

                            She has spent countless hours creating unique environments for our designers to showcase their new collections. Liz also personally oversaw the construction of our new 2,000 sq ft Showroom in the Garment District. Her attention to detail is exemplary not to mention the ability to solve issues quickly! Consistently Liz and her team go above and beyond to get the job done with a smile.”

All the decisions she makes are always in their best interest. She treats her crews very well with much parity.  Liz has a good instinct for people’s strengths and weaknesses, which she utilizes when assigning them to tasks or pairing a seasoned member with one that is new to the task. She takes a personal interest in her crews and as a result, many are loyal to her; it also instills a team-setting, collaborative atmosphere. Her managing style is both organic and structured. Since she always has a plan and is detail-oriented, she allows them to work independently but maintain a professional and organized effort. She has a good level of trust, which means she doesn’t micro- manage. She communicates clearly and with detail so they know what she expects. She is a problem-solver and when crews make mistakes on a booth, instead of chastising them, she problem solves it in a collaborative way.”
